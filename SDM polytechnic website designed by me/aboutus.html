                This line is taken from “Taittiriya Upanishad”. It means scientific knowledge is brahma. 
                (As Bhrugu maharshi realised) One needs to understand Science and Technology to know the eternal truth. 
                Foliages represent growth and prosperity.
                Whereas, the earth and satellite signify the role of science & technology in enabling us to get connected across the globe and to understand the universe in detail.
                The color blue symbolizes: Calmness, Stability, Trust, Loyalty, Inspiration, Creativity, Spirituality, Intuition, Depth, Wisdom. Saffron is a sacred color that symbolizes: Sacrifice, Purity, Wisdom, Light and Quest for salvation.
